This project is a simple online store product showcase built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can browse through categories like men's, women's, and kids' items. Product data is fetched dynamically from the FakeStoreAPI, providing up-to-date information. The interface features category selection and displays product cards with essential details such as name, vendor, and prices. Some products may have badges indicating special offers or new arrivals. The code is split into index.html, style.css, and script.js, organizing layout, styling, and functionality. It serves as a practical example of building a responsive online store interface using basic web technologies
